# Forensics Detective (Project 2)
# Task 2 overview:
I applied 5 different image augmentations to each original document image. Each augmentation represents normal distortions found in real documents. For every original image, I generated five augmented variants, resulting in a dataset size increase of approximately 6× (original + augmented).
Methods:
1. Gaussian noise- I added random pixel noise to the images.
2. Jpeg compression- I saved images using jpeg compression (basically losing data)3. Downsampling- I reduced image sizes (by 50%) and then brought them back to thier original dimensions.
4. Random cropping- I cropped small portions of the images and then resized them back to thier original dimensions.
5. Bit depth reduction- I decreased the number of bits used to represent each image (4-bit level reduction).

All augmentations were applied independently to the original images, rather than sequentially chaining transformations. This ensures that each augmentation represents a distinct and interpretable type of distortion.

## Project Information
- **Created By:** Justin Del Vecchio
- **Version:** 0.2
- **Date Created:** September 14, 2025
- **Last Updated:** September 19, 2025

## Target Community of Interest
Cybersecurity forensics investigators. This research would benefit professionals who need to analyze digital artifacts and trace their origins, including:

- **Insider threat investigators** - tracking employee access patterns and identifying suspicious activities within organizations
- **Digital forensics analysts** - determining the provenance and authenticity of digital documents like PDFs, images, and other files
- **Incident response teams** - reconstructing attack timelines and understanding how threats moved through systems
- **Corporate security teams** - investigating data breaches and understanding what information was accessed or exfiltrated

## Research Goal
This project aims to develop a toolbox of machine learning-backed forensics investigation tools for cybersecurity professionals. The first tool in development is a PDF Provenance Detector that analyzes PDF documents to determine their creation method - whether they were exported from applications like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or programmatically generated using libraries such as Python's PDF creation tools. By identifying the generation source, cybersecurity teams can gain valuable context during investigations, potentially revealing information about threat actors' toolsets, document authenticity, and attack methodologies. This capability could also aid in insider threat identification, such as detecting employees with multiple company document PDFs exported from unauthorized systems like Google Docs when corporate policy requires approved platforms.

## Summary

This research addresses a novel application of machine learning to digital forensics through the development of a PDF Provenance Detector. The core methodology involves converting PDF documents to binary image representations and using image classification techniques to identify the creation software used to generate the PDFs.

The experimental approach centers on creating a controlled dataset of 400 documents with identical content but different PDF generation pathways. Wikipedia articles serve as the content source, ensuring diverse yet standardized text across multiple domains including science, history, geography, and technology. These articles are converted to Word documents, then exported to PDF using Microsoft Word's native PDF generation engine. The same content is subsequently uploaded to Google Docs and exported as PDFs using Google's PDF generation system, creating two distinct classes for binary classification.

The key innovation lies in converting the binary structure of PDFs into grayscale images, where each byte value (0-255) corresponds to a pixel intensity. This visualization approach transforms the abstract binary patterns inherent in different PDF generation engines into visually distinguishable signatures. Different PDF creators embed unique metadata structures, apply distinct compression algorithms, and utilize varying font rendering techniques that manifest as detectable patterns in the binary-to-image representation.

This methodology addresses a significant gap in current digital forensics capabilities. While existing expert systems rely heavily on metadata analysis for document provenance, such information can be easily manipulated or stripped by sophisticated actors. The binary visualization approach operates at a deeper structural level, detecting generation signatures that are inherently embedded in the PDF creation process and resistant to simple metadata manipulation.

The research objectives include: (1) demonstrating the feasibility of binary-to-image conversion for PDF classification, (2) achieving statistically significant classification accuracy between Word-generated and Google Docs-generated PDFs, (3) evaluating the robustness of the approach against metadata stripping, and (4) establishing a framework for expanding the toolbox to additional document creation applications and file types.

### Literature Review and Related Work

This research builds upon established techniques in digital forensics while addressing a significant gap in PDF provenance detection. The literature review reveals three key areas of related work that inform this project's methodology and novelty.

### Binary-to-Image Classification Techniques

The foundational technique of converting binary files to images for classification has been extensively validated in malware analysis. Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of transforming executable malware files into grayscale images for classification without requiring file execution, achieving accuracy rates of 98.96% for static analysis and 97.32% for dynamic analysis (Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022). The methodology involves converting binary content to grayscale PNG images using hexadecimal representation, then applying convolutional neural networks for pattern recognition. Advanced implementations using ResNet50, Xception, and EfficientNet-B4 achieve classification accuracies up to 92.48% while reducing computation time by 95% compared to traditional dynamic analysis methods.

### PDF Forensics and Document Authentication

Current PDF forensics research focuses primarily on malware detection and metadata analysis. Recent 2024 studies introduce advanced techniques including PDFObj2Vec representation learning and Graph Isomorphism Networks for structural feature extraction. The field recognizes PDF as the dominant medium for malware distribution (66.6% of malicious email attachments), driving development of sophisticated detection systems using BERT, Word2Vec, and graph neural networks. However, these approaches target malicious content detection rather than creator identification through binary signatures.

### Document Provenance and Creator Identification

Existing document forensics relies heavily on metadata analysis for creator identification. Current methods extract document information dictionaries and XMP metadata streams to identify creation tools, with Google Docs PDFs uniquely identified by Skia/PDF producer signatures and empty creator fields, while Word-generated PDFs contain Microsoft-specific metadata patterns. However, these approaches are vulnerable to metadata manipulation and stripping, creating the forensic gap this research addresses.

### Research Gap and Novel Contribution

The literature review confirms this project's novelty: while binary-to-image classification is well-established for malware analysis, and PDF forensics focuses on malware detection and metadata analysis, no previous research systematically applies binary visualization techniques to PDF creator identification. The combination of controlled content generation through Wikipedia articles, binary-to-image conversion, and creator classification represents an unexplored intersection of established methodologies.

### Supporting Tools and Resources

- [PDF Forensic Tool](https://github.com/xovim001/pdf-forensic) - GitHub Repository for PDF metadata extraction
- [Malware Image Detection Implementation](https://github.com/TanayBhadula/malware-image-detection) - CNN-based binary classification example
- [Best Tool for PDF Forensics](https://community.metaspike.com/t/best-tool-for-pdf-forensics/1090) - Community discussion on current limitations

This literature foundation demonstrates that while the individual components (binary visualization, PDF forensics, document provenance) have been studied, their integration for PDF creator identification through binary signatures represents a genuine contribution to the digital forensics field.
